Wash trading refers to the practice of artificially inflating trading volume by executing trades with oneself or coordinated entities. The Wash-Trading Address Detection task aims to identify addresses engaged in wash-trading activities within the Ethereum network. The ETGraph dataset provides a graph representation specifically designed for this purpose, enabling researchers to detect suspicious addresses involved in market manipulation.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data:** The ETGraph dataset includes a Twitter graph and an Ethereum graph, providing a holistic view of the Ethereum ecosystem and its connection with social media.

- **Wash-Trading Address Graph:** The dataset provides a graph representation for detecting wash-trading addresses within the Ethereum network. This feature helps researchers identify suspicious addresses engaged in market manipulation activities.

- **Anonymized Twitter Matching:** An anonymized Twitter accounts file matched with Ethereum addresses is included, allowing for the analysis of numerical ID associations without compromising personal information.

### Usage

Researchers can utilize the provided graph representation and anonymized Twitter matching to detect wash-trading addresses within the Ethereum network. By leveraging the comprehensive data, researchers can gain insights into market manipulation activities and enhance the integrity of the Ethereum ecosystem.

For more details on how to use the ETGraph dataset for wash-trading address detection, refer to the documentation and code examples provided.
