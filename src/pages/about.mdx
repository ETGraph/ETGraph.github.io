## Dataset Overview

The ETGraph dataset consists of several components:

1. **Twitter Graph:** This component captures the social network of Twitter users who are associated with Ethereum transactions. It provides a graph representation of the relationships between Twitter accounts, allowing researchers to analyze the influence and interactions of users in the Ethereum community.

2. **Ethereum Graph:** The Ethereum graph component contains a wealth of transaction records from the Ethereum blockchain. It includes details such as transaction hashes, block numbers, timestamps, sender and recipient addresses, and transaction values. This graph enables researchers to study transaction patterns, analyze network dynamics, and gain a deeper understanding of the Ethereum network's activities.

3. **Ethereum Graph with Twitter Features:** Building upon the Ethereum graph, this component incorporates additional Twitter features associated with Ethereum transactions. By combining social media data with blockchain records, researchers can explore the correlation between social media activities and specific transactions, allowing for in-depth analysis of sentiment dynamics, influence propagation, and the impact of social media on cryptocurrency markets.

4. **Wash-Trading Addresses Detection Graph:** This component focuses on detecting wash-trading addresses within the Ethereum network. It provides a graph representation that helps researchers identify suspicious addresses engaged in wash-trading activities, facilitating the study of market manipulation and enhancing the integrity of the Ethereum ecosystem.

The ETGraph dataset offers a comprehensive resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore the intricate dynamics between Ethereum transactions and Twitter interactions. It enables the study of transaction patterns, sentiment analysis, influence propagation, market manipulation detection, and more. Researchers can leverage the provided code and experiments to conduct innovative research and drive advancements in the field of blockchain and social media analysis.
