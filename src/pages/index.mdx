## Introduction

ETGraph is an extraordinary dataset that combines Ethereum transaction records
with Twitter data, offering an unprecedented opportunity to explore the
intersection of blockchain transactions and social media interactions. With its
vast collection of Ethereum transactions and corresponding Twitter data,
ETGraph provides a comprehensive view of the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling
researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to uncover valuable insights and
patterns.

## Key Features

The ETGraph dataset offers several key features that make it a valuable resource for analyzing the Ethereum ecosystem and its connection with Twitter:

- **Comprehensive Data:** The dataset includes a Twitter graph capturing the social network of users associated with Ethereum transactions and an Ethereum graph containing detailed transaction records from the blockchain. This comprehensive data enables in-depth analysis of transaction patterns, network dynamics, and the impact of social media on cryptocurrency markets.

- **Twitter Integration:** The dataset incorporates Twitter features associated with Ethereum transactions, allowing for the exploration of sentiment dynamics, influence propagation, and the correlation between social media activities and specific transactions.

- **Wash-Trading Address Detection:** A graph representation is provided to detect wash-trading addresses within the Ethereum network. This feature helps identify suspicious addresses engaged in market manipulation activities, enhancing the integrity of the Ethereum ecosystem.

- **Code and Experiments:** The dataset includes code and experiments for Ethereum link prediction and wash-trading address detection. Researchers can leverage this code to conduct innovative research and drive advancements in blockchain and social media analysis.

- **Anonymized Twitter Matching:** An anonymized Twitter accounts file matched with Ethereum addresses is included, allowing for the analysis of numerical ID associations without compromising personal information. This facilitates the study of user interactions within the Ethereum community.

With its comprehensive data, Twitter integration, wash-trading address detection, code and experiments, and anonymized Twitter matching, the ETGraph dataset provides a powerful toolkit for studying the Ethereum ecosystem and its relationship with social media. Researchers can gain valuable insights into transaction patterns, sentiment dynamics, influence propagation, and market manipulation detection, driving advancements in the field of blockchain analysis.
