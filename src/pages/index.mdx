## Introduction

EX-Graph is a rich dataset containing Ethereum transaction data and Twitter data. With a focus on bridging the gap between anonymous Ethereum activities and Twitter information, it's specifically designed to facilitate various tasks including Ethereum link prediction, wash-trading addresses detection, and matching link prediction between Ethereum addresses and Twitter accounts. By integrating these two different dimensions, EX-Graph provides an on-chain and off-chain resource for researchers and analysts to explore the complex dynamics of Ethereum.

## Key Features

The EX-Graph dataset offers several key features that make it a valuable resource for analyzing the Ethereum network and its connection with Twitter:

- **Comprehensive Data:** The dataset includes a Twitter graph capturing the social network of users associated with Ethereum transactions and an Ethereum graph containing detailed transaction records from the blockchain. This comprehensive data enables in-depth analysis of transaction patterns, network dynamics, and the impact of social media on cryptocurrency markets.

- **Twitter Integration:** The dataset incorporates Twitter features associated with Ethereum transactions, allowing for the exploration of sentiment dynamics, influence propagation, and the correlation between social media activities and specific transactions.

- **Wash-Trading Addresses Detection:** A graph representation is provided to detect wash-trading addresses within the Ethereum network. This feature helps identify suspicious addresses engaged in market manipulation activities, enhancing the integrity of the Ethereum network.

- **Code and Experiments:** The dataset includes code and experiments for Ethereum link prediction, wash-trading address detection, and matching link prediction. Researchers can utilize this code to conduct innovative research and drive advancements in blockchain and social media analysis.

- **Anonymized Twitter Matching:** An anonymized Twitter accounts file matched with Ethereum addresses is included which facilitates the study of off-chain user interactions within the Ethereum community.

With its comprehensive data, Twitter integration, wash-trading address detection, code and experiments, and anonymized Twitter matching, the EX-Graph dataset provides a powerful toolkit for studying the Ethereum network and its relationship with Twitter. Researchers can gain valuable insights into transaction patterns, sentiment dynamics, influence propagation, and market manipulation detection, driving advancements in the field of blockchain analysis.
